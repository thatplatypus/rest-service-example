# BackEnd Java Services

The contents of this project are different end points of POST /request, POST /callback/{id}, PUT /callback/{id}, GET /status/{id}. These services are build on the java Spring framework.

This example also includes what configuration would be necessary to connect the application to a database to hold the request's id, status, body, and detail.

The repository can be cloned or downloaded. If opened in an IDE it can be ran as a java application. The root project folder to import is cs-service inside of cs-rest-service. If Run Configuration is needed for the Java Application the project should point to cs-service and the mainclass should be pointed to com.example.restservice.RestServiceApplication

Inside of the cs-service folder there is also RestService.jar which can be ran from the commandline with java -jar RestService.jar and that will start the server for listening to the endpoint requests.

By default the server will start on http://localhost:8080.

SoapUI or similar application to make a REST call can be used to test the endpoints.

Example endpoints and inputs:

## http://localhost:8080/request : POST

Request Body (JSON)
```
{
  "body" : "Example Test Data"
}
```
##  http://localhost:8080/callback/{id} : POST

Request Body (Text)
```
STARTED
```
## http://localhost:8080/callback/{id} : PUT

Request Body (JSON)
```
{
	"status" : "COMPLETED",
	"detail" : "request completed"	
}
```
## http://localhost:8080/status/{id} : GET
Response
```
Returns Object
```
